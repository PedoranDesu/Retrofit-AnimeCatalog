# Anime Catalog

After finishing Google's Kotlin Fundamental Codelabs, there was some itchy feels that pushed me to create this project -- that contains everything I've learn in Codelabs -- immediately.

> As for why I choose Anime as a main topic is, mainly, because I know more about Anime than normal cinema films.

## Installation

Just Import This Project Into Android Studio...

As a retrofit apps, some of you might wondering where you should put that API Key, but there isn't any need to get an API Key

> ( Except Jikan API Changed Their Policy, There's No Need )

## Tech Stack

This project utilize [Jikan](https://jikan.docs.apiary.io/), a free MyAnimeList API.

Also includes Jetpack Components (while messy)
